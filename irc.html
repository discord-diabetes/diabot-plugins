    <h1>Joining IRC</h1>
    <p>First time on any Freenode IRC channel? If you want to reserve your username and be recognized by fellow members of the channel, you'll need to <a href="http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup">register your nick with Freenode</a>.
   </p>
  
    <h1>Your first visit</h1>
    
    <p>So you've decided to come visit the IRC channel. Welcome! When you join, you're probably going to see
    something like this:</p>
    <pre>
[21:13:43] &lt;greenconverse&gt; Yeah, I would not EVER wear a tutu
[21:13:49] &lt;oh_bother&gt; I have
[21:13:50] &lt;greenconverse&gt; oh_bother: you should
[21:14:05] &lt;daffyd-type1&gt; hahahaha
[21:14:08] &lt;greenconverse&gt; I have....when I took ballet when I was 4 years old
[21:14:08] &lt;oh_bother&gt; nothing beats the whimsy of a purple polka dotted tutu
[21:14:16] &lt;greenconverse&gt; But....i'm not girly at all haha.
[21:15:12] &lt;greenconverse&gt; but when guys do it...it's funny....but when girls do it...it's not a joke thing...it's a girl thing haha
[21:15:37] &lt;oh_bother&gt; clearly you have not seen the tutus to which I refer
[21:15:41] &lt;greenconverse&gt; clearly
</pre>
    <p>We tend to talk about anything that's on our mind. If you want to talk about something diabetes-related, just speak up. We'll be glad to talk about it with you.</p>
    <p>Eventually, you'll see someone type in a number or command and immediately get a reply:</p>
    <pre>
[22:01:40] &lt;toystoriegirl&gt; 182
[22:01:40] &lt;@diabot&gt; toystoriegirl: 182 mg/dL = 10.1 mmol/L
</pre>
    <p>That's diabot, a program awaxa runs on his computer. It helps out in the channel doing various things. Here,
    it's <a href="#bg">translating blood sugars</a> from one set of units to the other. Since Americans and Europeans use different
    units to track blood sugar, this helps us keep everyone on the same page. Posting your blood sugar to the channel
    helps you remember it better, and don't worry: we are not judgemental, and most of us have had bad days before.
    Try it out.</p>
    <p>After you've been participating in the discussion for a while, you might want to see how well you're
    doing. Diabot has you covered there as well. Type in <code>`lastbgs</code>, and it'll <a href="#lastbgs">reply with the past few
    entries</a>:</p>
    <pre>
[00:12:02] &lt;trippingbackward&gt; 'lastbgs
[00:12:02] &lt;diabot&gt; trippingbackward: [11:01] 204, [02:58] 107, and [4:42] 78 </pre>
    <p>This is a good way to see how your blood sugar changes over time. Wait a minute... Someone asked you your age,
    and diabot thought it was a blood sugar? <a href="#bgoops">Oops</a>! That's going to throw things off a bit. Let's fix that:</p>
    <pre>
[00:00:02] &lt;daffyd-type1&gt; lol i am 47 lolz cheer up LOlz
[00:00:26] &lt;oh_bother&gt; fffffuuuuu
[00:00:31] &lt;oh_bother&gt; 28
[00:00:31] &lt;@diabot&gt; oh_bother: 28.0 mmol/L = 505 mg/dL
[00:00:40] &lt;oh_bother&gt; 'bgoops
[00:00:40] &lt;@diabot&gt; oh_bother: The operation succeeded.
[00:00:48] &lt;daffyd-type1&gt; hahahahaa</pre>
    <p>One of the pieces of paper you may have gotten from your doctor is an HbA<sub>1C</sub> lab report. The sugar in
    your blood changes your red blood cells slightly, and this can be used to figure out your average blood sugar over
    the life of those cells (about 60-90 days). Unfortunately, the math to make this conversion is rather complicated,
    but fortunately <a href="#estbg">you're not the one</a> who has to do it:</p>
    <pre>
 
</pre>
    <p>You can also go <a href="#esta1c">the other way</a>, and see what A1C you'd get if you constantly had a certain blood sugar.</p>
    <p>Once you've been chatting with us for a couple of days, you'll notice your <code>`lastbgs</code> results
    start disappearing. This is normal for two reasons. Firstly, by default, it will only print out the last ten, so it
    doesn't overwhelm you or the channel with lots and lots of numbers. Secondly, unless you specify otherwise,
    diabot will only store results within the past 1,000 chat messages. This is for both efficiency and privacy
    concerns. However, you can get it to <a href="#bgoptin">store them for longer</a> if you like:</p>
    <pre>
 
</pre>
    <div class="alert alert-warning inset">
      <span class="label label-warning">Privacy notice</span> While we follow industry standards for safeguarding the
      information stored in diabot, no security is perfect, and we are not responsible should the medical information
      you provide us become public knowledge. We operate this service for your convenience, but with no liability or
      warranty. If you do not want to take this risk, please do not opt in.
    </div>
    <p>Diabot will then start storing your BGs in a separate database. From time to time, entries that become older
    than the retention period you set will be removed, to help protect your privacy, but they'll be held on to
    until then. This also lets you use another neat feature: tagging. You can add a list of words to your blood sugar,
    like &quot;post breakfast&quot; or &quot;pizza&quot;, and they'll be shown in the list and can be used as a
    filter:</p>
    <pre>
[00:00:02] &lt;Ariensus&gt; 'bg 127 after dinner
[00:00:26] &lt;diabot&gt; Ariensus: 127 mg/dL = 7.0 mmol/L</pre>
    <p>Finally, someone posted something that seems funny? Want diabot to remember it for future laughs later? Just
    <code><a href="#grab">`grab</a></code> it!</p>
    <pre>
 
</pre>
    <p>This isn't everthing diabot can do, but hopefully you'll feel right at home.</p>

    <p>Estimates what the average blood sugar over the past 60-90 days was for a patient with the given glycated
    hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>) level. As sugar circulates in the blood, it causes small changes to the hemoglobin
    in red blood cells. These changes can be detected and give a window into the amount of glucose present over the
    lifetime of the cells.For example, an A1C of 7.0% (51 mmol/L) reflects an average glucose of 154 mg/dL (8.6
    mmol/L). Americans measure the percent of all hemoglobin that is glycated (&quot;DCCT&quot;, named after a famous
    clinical trial, or &quot;NGSP&quot;, a standards program set up to match measurements against DCCT), while

    <p>Normally diabot only retains the last 1,000 lines of chat history, and the blood sugar entries within it. Using
    this command tells it to store your blood sugar entries in a separate database, retaining them for the length of
    time you specify. You must specify a specific number of days or entries; once entries become older than this, they
    will be deleted the next time you add one or list them. This also enables saving tags, your BG entries following
    you if your nick changes (if you're registered and identified with diabot), and possibly other features in the
    future. <em>(This is separate from <a href="#nickserv">registering with NickServ</a>, and separate from 
	<a href="#register">registering a diabot account</a>.)</em>
    To remove all information stored with this command, use <code>bgoptout</code>.</p>

    <p>These commands are not specific to diabetes, but they're amusing and you'll see them pretty often.</p>
    <h2><span id="register">register</span>, <span id="identify">identify</span>, <span id="hostmask">hostmask</span></h2>
		  <p><strong>Usage:</strong> <code>register <em>&lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</em></code><br>
    <strong>Usage:</strong> <code>identify <em>&lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</em></code><br>
    <strong>Usage:</strong> <code>hostmask add <em>&lt;nick&gt;</em>!<em>&lt;ident&gt;</em>@<em>&lt;example.org&gt;</em></code></p>
        <div class="alert alert-info inset">
      <span class="label label-info">Note</span> These commands must be sent privately to the bot, because they include 
				a password. Also, this is different from <a href="#nickserv">identifying to NickServ</a> and 
				<a href="#bgoptin">opting in</a> to data collection.</div>
    <pre style="background-color:bisque">
[18:05:57] &lt;TwelveBaud&gt; identify TwelveBaud <span style="color:coral" title="Not actually my real password. ;)">googlyB34R</span>
[18:05:58] &lt;diabot&gt; The operation succeeded.
</pre>
		  <p>Registering with diabot allows you to use the <a href="#flair">flair</a> features and, if you've opted into data collection and 
		  set a hostmask, lets your BG information follow nickname changes. It also allows awaxa to consider you for 
		  additional privileges. However, it is not compulsary, and most members of the channel aren't registered there. 
		  Once you've registered, you can identify yourself to have access to these features.</p>
		  <p>You can also use hostmasks as a way to automatically log you in, so you don't need to identify yourself. 
		  Unfortunately, discussing them in depth is beyond the scope of this article, but here is one example:</p>
		  <pre style="background-color:bisque">[16:53:58] &lt;TwelveBaud&gt; hostmask add TwelveB*!~jester@*.washdc.fios.verizon.net
[16:53:58] &lt;diabot&gt; The operation succeeded.</pre>
		  <p>This means anyone with a nickname beginning with "TwelveB", logged into their local computer as "jester", 
		  and connecting from a Washington DC FiOS connection will automatically be identified as "TwelveBaud". You can 
		  get this information by running <code>/whois</code> on yourself.</p>    <h2><span id="grab">grab</span>, <span id="grand">grand</span></h2>

		  <p><code>grab</code> allows you to save a funny or amusing quote from someone in a private collection to be 
		  recalled later. If it turns out that what was actually saved just isn't that funny, <code>ungrab</code> can be used to 
		  remove it. You can also get someone's last quote with <code>glast</code> or (most commonly) a random out-of-context quote 
		  with <code>grand</code>. Finally, if you remember something about a quote from long ago, you can use <code>gsearch</code> to find it 
		  again, and <code>gget</code> to show it to the rest of the channel.</p>

		  <p>A simple Russian Roulette-esque game. When it starts up, diabot puts a "bullet" in one of six "barrels", 
		  and "spins" them around. A random number from zero to five people can run <code>roulette</code> without ill effects. 
		  However, eventually someone will be "shot" (kicked from the channel). When that happens, a new bullet is 
		  inserted and the game restarts. You can also manually "spin" the barrels to reset your chances. Do you feel 
		  lucky? Well, <em>do you?</em></p>
