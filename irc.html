        like this:

[21:13:43] &lt;greenconverse&gt; Yeah, I would not EVER wear a tutu

[21:14:08] &lt;greenconverse&gt; I have....when I took ballet when I was 4 years old
[21:14:08] &lt;oh_bother&gt; nothing beats the whimsy of a purple polka dotted tutu
[21:14:16] &lt;greenconverse&gt; But....i'm not girly at all haha.
[21:15:12] &lt;greenconverse&gt; but when guys do it...it's funny....but when girls do it...it's not a joke thing...it's a girl thing haha
[21:15:37] &lt;oh_bother&gt; clearly you have not seen the tutus to which I refer

        Diabetics are people too, and we talk about anything that's on our mind, not just diabetes. Diabetes
        conversations always come first, but feel free to join in about whatever you like; we're all in this together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, someone will type in a number and immediately get a reply:
      </p>

        That's diabot, a program awaxa runs on his computer. It helps out in the channel doing various things. Here,
        it's translating blood sugars from one set of units to the other. Since Americans and Europeans use different
        units to track blood sugar, this helps us keep everyone on the same page. Posting your blood sugar to the
        channel helps you remember it better, and don't worry: we are not judgemental, and most of us have had bad days
        before. Try it and see.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you've been participating in the discussion for a while, you might want to see how well you're doing.
        Diabot has you covered there as well. Type in <code>`lastbgs</code>, and it'll reply with the past few entries:
      </p>
      <pre>
 
</pre>
      <p>
        This is a good way to see how your blood sugar changes over time. Wait a minute... Someone asked you your age,
        and diabot thought it was a blood sugar? That's going to throw things off a bit. Let's fix that:
      </p>
      <pre>
 
</pre>
      <p>
        One of the pieces of paper you may have gotten from your doctor is an HbA<sub>1C</sub> lab report. The sugar in
        your blood changes your red blood cells slightly, and this can be used to figure out your average blood sugar
        over the life of those cells (about 60-90 days). Unfortunately, the math to make this conversion is rather
        complicated, but fortunately you're not the one who has to do it:
      </p>
      <pre>
 
</pre>
      <p>
        You can also go the other way, and see what A1C you'd get if you constantly had a certain blood sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've been chatting with us for a couple of days, you'll notice your `lastbgs results start disappearing.
        This is normal for two reasons. Firstly, by default, it will only print out the last ten, so it doesn't
        overwhelm you or the channel with lots and lots of numbers. Secondly, unless you specify otherwise, diabot will
        only store results within the past 1,000 chat messages. This is for both efficiency and privacy concerns.
        However, you can get it to store them for longer if you like:
      </p>
      <pre>
 
</pre>
      <div class="alert alert-warning inset">
        <span class="label label-warning">Privacy notice</span> While we follow industry standards for safeguarding the
        information stored in diabot, no security is perfect, and we are not responsible should the medical information
        you provide us become public knowledge. We operate this service for your convenience, but with no liability or
        warranty. If you do not want to take this risk, please do not opt in.
      </div>
      <p>
        Diabot will then start storing your BGs in a separate database. From time to time, entries that become older
        than the retention period you set will be removed, to help protect your privacy, but they'll be held on to
        until then. This also lets you use another neat feature: tagging. You can add a list of words to your blood
        sugar, like "post breakfast" or "pizza", and they'll be shown in the list and can be used as a filter:
      </p>
      <pre>
 
</pre>
      <p>
        Finally, someone posted something that seems funny? Want diabot to remember it for future laughs later? Just
        `grab it!
      </p>
      <pre>
 
</pre>
      <p>
        This isn't everthing diabot can do, but hopefully you'll feel right at home.

        Stores your blood sugar so it can be recalled later with lastbgs. It also prints a conversion from milligrams
        per decileter, used in the United States, to millimoles per liter, used in Europe, or the corresponding reverse
        conversion. If you've opted in to extended collection, you can also add a list of tag words, such as "post
        breakfast" or "pizzanight" which will be stored with the entry. (You must use the long form of the command, and
        their order will not be preserved.) Entries will be stored for 1,000 chat messages, or for however long you

        (such as "post breakfast" or "pizzanight"), and only entries with all of those tag words will be displayed. The
        entries are displayed in the following format: <code>[time] BG (tag ...)</code>. If the entry is less than 24
        hours old, only the time will be shown; if the entry is less than 7 days old, the weekday and time will be
        shown; otherwise the month, day, and time will be shown. All entries are shown in US Eastern Standard Time
        (GMT-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (GMT-4).

        Estimates what the results of a glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>) test would be if the patient averaged a
        given blood sugar. As sugar circulates in the blood, it causes small changes to the hemoglobin in red blood
        cells. These changes can be detected and give a window into the amount of glucose present over the lifetime of
        the cells. For example, a consistent 154 mg/dL glucose (8.6 mmol/L) would produce an A1C of 7.0% (51 mmol/mol).
        Americans measure the percent of all hemoglobin that is glycated ("DCCT", named after a famous clinical trial,
        or "NGSP", a standards program set up to match measurements against DCCT), while Europeans measure the
        proportion of molecular weight ("IFCC", named after a chemistry body).

        Estimates what the average blood sugar over the past 60-90 days was for a patient with the given glycated
        hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>) level.&nbsp; As sugar circulates in the blood, it causes small changes to the
        hemoglobin in red blood cells. These changes can be detected and give a window into the amount of glucose
        present over the lifetime of the cells.For example, an A1C of 7.0% (51 mmol/L) reflects an average glucose of
        154 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L). Americans measure the percent of all hemoglobin that is glycated ("DCCT", named after a
        famous clinical trial, or "NGSP", a standards program set up to match measurements against DCCT), while
        Europeans measure the proportion of molecular weight ("IFCC", named after a chemistry body). If diabot
        misinterprets the units (very rare), you can explicitly specify DCCT or IFCC units.

        <span class="label label-info">Note</span> This estimation has a very large margin of error. The test assumes a
        body with a normal volume of blood and a "normal" age mix of red blood cell ages. Even if those conditions
        hold, there is still a lot of variability. For the example given, the 95% confidence range is as large as
        &#177;32 mg/dL (&#177;1.8 mmol/L). It is not a replacement for regular blood glucose tests.

        Normally diabot only retains the last 1,000 lines of chat history, and the blood sugar entries within it. Using
        this command tells it to store your blood sugar entries in a separate database, retaining them for the length
        of time you specify. You must specify a specific number of days or entries; once entries become older than
        this, they will be deleted the next time you add one or list them. This also enables saving tags, your BG
        entries following you if your nick changes (if you're registered and identified with diabot), and possibly
        other features in the future. <em>(This is separate from registering with NickServ, and separate from
        registering a diabot account.)</em> To remove all information stored with this command, use bgoptout.
